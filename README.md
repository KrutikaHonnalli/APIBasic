# API Basic
**What is Header ?**

 Header is a key-value pair that included in the HTTP request or response. Headers provide metadata or additional information that guides the server or client on how to process the request or response. They play a critical role in enabling communication between the client and the server.

**Why Headers are Important in APIs**

1. **Standardization**: Ensures that the server and client communicate efficiently and correctly using standard protocols.
2. **Security**: Enables authentication and authorization to secure the API.
3. **Flexibility**: Allows passing additional information without altering the main request/response payload.
4. **Performance** Optimization: Facilitates caching and compression for efficient resource management.

**Commanly used API Header**
1. **Content-Type Header**: Specifies the media type of the request or response body so the server/client can understand and parse it.
2. **Accept Header** : Indicates what content types the client can handle. The server responds with data in one of the specified formats.
3. **Authorization Header** : Headers often carry credentials (e.g., API keys, tokens) required to authenticate a user or application.
4. **User-Agent Header** :Provides information about the client making the request, such as the browser, OS, or application.
5. **Cache-Control Header**: Controls how caching is handled for responses to improve performance.
